# eci35_hetprog

This repo is a fork with solutions to the labs from the `Heterogeneous
Programming Models: Portability, performance and computability` module
taught at [ECI](https://eci.dc.uba.ar/) 35th edition in 2022 by Dario
Su√°rez Gracia.

To build (and run) the solutions it's recommended to use the
[intel/oneapi](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/oneapi) docker image,
everything *should* work out of the box there.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
